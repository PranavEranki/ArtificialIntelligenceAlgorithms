# Artificial Intelligence
This repo contains most of the common algorithms you'd find in Artificial Intelligence, this includes Machine Learning and Deep Learning subsets.
It provides notes, examples, and datasets to use for anyone looking to learn about AI.
I recommend researching all of the mathematics that go into these algorithms, since it's very heavy on Linear Algebra and Calculus, if you want to understand them completely. 
Feel free to download this repo and play around with the algorithms to explore the ideas involved.

Disclaimer: Most of the Deep Learning material requires a lot of computational resources. It is highly recommended to use Tensorflow-GPU which will enable your GPU for Deep Learning, you can still use CPU processing but time and effeciency is significantly impacted.
